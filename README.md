# EMGC²F: Efficient Multi-view Graph Clustering with Comprehensive Fusion

This is the official implementation of our IJCAI-22 paper _EMGC²F: Efficient Multi-view Graph Clustering with Comprehensive Fusion_.

Run `EMGC2F_demo.m` to reproduce our results.

The source code in `finchpp` folder is based on https://github.com/ssarfraz/FINCH-Clustering and slightly modified to fulfill our needs.
